# Daily Drops — 2026-02-04 (Wed)

## Trending AI / Tech News
- **Xcode 26.3 adds “agentic coding” via MCP** (Claude/Codex + other MCP-compatible agents; deeper IDE primitives via MCP endpoint). https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/xcode-26-3-adds-support-for-claude-codex-and-other-agentic-tools-via-mcp/
- **Agentic AI security is becoming its own attack surface** (good angle for content: “agents expand data exposure risk; treat tools + permissions like prod infra”). https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/2026-agentic-ai-attack-surface-poster-child

## Interesting GitHub Repos (AI / Mobile / Health-tech)
- **obra/superpowers** — skills-based workflow framework for coding agents (design → plan → TDD). Good inspiration for enforcing “no hallucinations” + process discipline in Nutriproof dev. https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- **opencode-ai/opencode** — open-source terminal coding agent (useful for automations + CI agent tasks). https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode
- **simonoppowa/OpenNutriTracker** — privacy-first nutrition tracker (Flutter) using Open Food Facts + USDA FoodData Central. Great reference for food DB + barcode flow + clean architecture. https://github.com/simonoppowa/OpenNutriTracker

## Business Ideas / Opportunities
- **“AI Agent Security Checklist” micro-product**: lightweight scanner that inventories agent tools + permissions (MCP servers, API keys, file access) and outputs a risk report + hardening checklist (teams adopting agentic workflows will need this).
- **Nutriproof wedge:** “Evidence-first ingredient explainer” (citations-first UX) + *exportable* reports (PDF/share cards) for parents / fitness coaches / clinicians.

## Useful Tools / APIs
- **Open Food Facts API** (free, broad coverage; good for barcode → product baseline). https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data
- **USDA FoodData Central API** (official US nutrition dataset; strong for completeness / validation). https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
- **Public APIs listing for Open Food Facts** (handy reference + status/pricing notes). https://publicapis.io/open-food-facts-api

## Evening Update (5pm UTC)
### Major AI / Tech News (today)
- **GitHub considering repo-level controls to reduce low-quality / AI-generated PR spam** (e.g., disable PRs, delete PRs) — could become a standard maintainer-side safety valve. https://www.infoworld.com/article/4127156/github-eyes-restrictions-on-pull-requests-to-rein-in-ai-based-code-deluge-on-maintainers.html
- **MIT Tech Review: “AI boosterism” + social-media hype loops** (Demis Hassabis calling “This is embarrassing” re: overhyped claims about LLMs solving hard math problems) — great framing for a short: “why hype ≠ capability.” https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/04/1132115/the-download-the-future-of-nuclear-power-plants-and-social-media-fueled-ai-hype/
- **Intel renews data-center GPU push to challenge Nvidia** (Reuters via TechStartups roundup) — more competitive pressure on AI infra pricing if Intel ships credible parts. https://techstartups.com/2026/02/04/top-tech-news-today-february-4-2026/

### Useful Resource
- **LLM model release tracking** (handy for monitoring provider/version churn without living on X): https://llm-stats.com/llm-updates

### Note
- Brave Search rate-limited today, so this is a focused capture from a few sources.
